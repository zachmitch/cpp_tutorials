In this lesson we focus mainly on functions.  Functions are encapsulated (think of a closed box) bits of code that can be reused in different parts of your program.  Image calling some function <code>foo();</code> instead of writing all that code over and over again.  Functions save you time and frustration, thus making happier programmers.  Happier programmers == happier people == happier Earth!  Yay!

Our other important topic was passing arguments by value and reference. The biggest difference is that when you pass by value, you are making a copy of the argument inside the function.  Whereas when you pass by reference (address), your function is not making a copy, but instead working on the same exact variable that was passed to the function as an argument.  

Again, the main reason why you would pass by reference would be if you were passing very large arguments, it would be costly (in terms of compute power and time) to make copies of them.  

The function definition for passing by reference is subtle, but as an example here is some made up function named foo that takes an integer parameter by reference.. <code>foo(int * x){...}</code>.  Notice that the <code> * </code> is the only difference (in the definition) from passing by value.  The other difference would be when calling the function foo(), you pass it an argument by address by adding the '&' character, such as <code>foo(&someNum);</code> for some variable named someNum.  And again if you wanted to access the value inside someNum within foo(), you do so by de-referencing the variable with the star again:  <code>int temp = *x </code>.
