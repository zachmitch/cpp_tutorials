  We've learned the very basics of a C++ program and introduced you to the critical idea of what a variable is.  In our next section we will expand on variables and start doing a little bit with numbers.  But don't worry if you're not strong at math, it's logic skills that are important!

The main thing to remember from this first video is to stay consistent with your code.  Everyone has particular quirks when they're coding, whether it be bracket placement, how you name items in your program, etc... As long as your quirks are consistent and your code is legible, its OK! It's <em>your</em> style.

Leaving comments is very important while programming.  You will write code that you visit weeks/months/years later and wonder, "What the heck was I thinking?"  If that happens to you with <em>your own code</em>, imagine what it must be like for someone else looking at it.

These simple comments here may seem unnecessary, but it's building good habits for your later work.  Once you build more sophisticated programs you won't leave comments for every simple thing. Your comments will focus on <em>why</em> you made a design choice, <em>how</em> a bit of code works, and <em>what</em> to do or not to do with some bit of code.

Cout and cin are some very basic functions you'll find in what is the enormous C++ Standard Library.  For a complete list of everything included in the C++ Standard Library, I'd recommend this nice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Standard_Library">Wikipedia article</a>.
