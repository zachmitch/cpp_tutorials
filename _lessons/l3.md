The if statement is a fundamental building block of programming that checks to see if something is true or false, and from that assertion executes some bit of code.

Control flow is directing the path that your code takes, oftentimes through the use of if/else if/else statements.  You would use multiple if statements when testing for different criteria, for instance testing the type of code and the code's length (<code>if(code == "C++")...if(code.length() > 100)</code>), as opposed to an if/else if statement when testing related criteria, the code's length (<code>if(code.length() > 100)...else if(code.length() <= 100 && code.length() > 0)</code>).

Relational operators are for comparing data.  They include less than (<), greater than (>), less than or equal (<=), greater than or equal (>=), equal (==), not equal (!=).

The difference between the while and do-while statements is when you check to see if your stopping point has been reached.  While checks before executing code in the code block, do-while checks after.


The increment and decrement operators (x++, ++x, x--, --x) are simple shorthand ways to increase or decrease a variable by one.  Be sure to remember that ++x would increment before the variable x is used on that line, whereas x++ would be incremented after x is used on the same line.
