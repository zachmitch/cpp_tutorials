Here is a <a href="https://www.w3schools.in/cplusplus-tutorial/keywords/">list of reserved keywords in C++ </a>.  Again these cannot be used for variable or function names in your code.

The programs in this course will only use the primitive data types of: int (Ex: 1, 42, -46), double (3.14159, -6.7, 1.0), char ('a', 'b', 'z'), bool (true, false), void (nothing), and string ("MakeThings", "Monkey business 123").  You will be able to create a lot just with these few.  

For a complete list of C++ datatypes, check this <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-data-types/"> list of data types in C++ </a>, which includes examples of each. You'll find that most are simply variations of the primitive set we use, so you the programmer can have more control over the contents and size of a variable.

  std::cin >> t1;

Const variables are used when you do not want the data that they hold to be modified, for instance, the value of PI (3.14159).  Creating the variable <code>const double pi = 3.14159;</code> and using it throughout your code is a much easier alternative than writing out the number each time and possibly making a mistake, and safer as no other bit of code can change it.

Using the "using" keyword allows you to access library functions in your code without having to having to write the library the function comes from each time (Ex: cout instead of std::cout).  Remember that we want to specifically say which functions we want to use instead of using the entire namespace (library) as conflicts will arise if there are two functions with the same name in separate namespaces.

Math isn't so bad in C++, right? The only 'weird' thing you may see is the modulus operator as it's outside the normal math operators you learned in school like addition, subtraction, etc.  It's only the remainder after dividing two integers and this concept will become second nature to you soon.
