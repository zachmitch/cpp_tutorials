	    Make Things with C++

	A Project-based education resource for C++

******************************************************/

The purpose of this collection is to educate people how to program using C++! Though many resources exist, I've yet to find a solid project-based set of tutorials that challenge the user to MAKE THINGS.  The aim is to take a novice programmer from "Hello World!" to building a command-line video game over the space of about 20(ish) modules.  

If you have any questions, comments, or would like to contribute, please email me at the address above.
